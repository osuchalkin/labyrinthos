### Files
All 3D-geometry, player's configuration and others are in util/pseudo3d.py.  
Also there are auxiliary files for text images and working with archives.  

File data.dat is a zip-archive which stored textures, sprites, sounds.   
The game unpack archive to directory and delete it in the end of the game.

### Game
The 1st labyrinth is a Knossos' labyrinth. It means it has one enter and the same exit.  
In this level player doesn't have a weapon and must find it.  

The others labyrinths are generated by game, theoretically infinite :)  They have one enter and another exit.
